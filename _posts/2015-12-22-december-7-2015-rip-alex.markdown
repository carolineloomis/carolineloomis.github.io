I realize that I haven’t written anything on here in forever, but I honestly got lazy. There’s a lot of things I have to update y'all on before I continue, but today I’m only going to talk about one of the biggest and most significant updates (i don’t know who I am referring to when I say y'all…). 

On Tuesday, November 17 I found out some horrific news that one of my most cherished friends passed away on Monday night. Alex James Dunn was genuinely one of (if not the…) strongest guys that I’ve ever known. On Instagram and Facebook I wrote a short dedication to honor him and express my feelings about his recent passing. It reads this: 

today i found out some heartbreaking news that one of my closest friends passed away last night. ive been friends with alex since the very beginning. before the cancer, before the headaches, before the surgeries, before his condition became terminal. i can honestly say that he never failed to make me smile and brighten up my day. when his battle with cancer began, our friendship grew stronger. alex was my date to prom, my best friend, and my inspiration. he taught me so many lessons over the past two years that i couldn’t have learned from anyone else. i was fortunate enough to attend his make a wish party just last month and despite the cancer, he kicked my butt at every arcade game and still acted like the cheerful alex i knew. he will always be my best friend and i will always treasure the special bond we had. rip alex 💗

To my surprise, Alex’s family saw my tribute and took comfort in it. His aunt actually read my tribute above at his funeral, which meant a lot to me. His aunt, parents, grandma, and brother, all had such powerful things to say in response to my effortless caption. 

his brother wrote: 

“Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for my brother, he adored you. Talked about you all the time. He shared a very special bond with those he held close and we are lucky that we got to experience his light. If you would like to talk please don’t hesitate to do so.”

his aunt:

“Carly…Alex’s mother shared your sweet message with me. Your love, kindness and friendship with Alex was so special and was so lucky to have you in his life. Sending you a hug too.”

his grandma:

“Thank you Carly, for bringing so much joy to Alex’s life - he loved you. From Alex’s grandma with love
